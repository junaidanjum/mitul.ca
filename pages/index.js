              Currently, I'm on the search for my next adventure, ideally as an
              Associate Product Manager or Product Analyst. I'm passionate about
              building a deep understanding of customers to design product
              experiences that can only be defined as magic âœ¨ My goal is pretty
              simple, build great things with great people. If we can work
              together to achieve that,{" "}

              Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve been building my craft as a
              photographer. I managed to turn a hobby into a business, which
              allowed me to achieve goals I never thought I could. This included
              photographing the Uber CEO, being paid to travel and working with
              brands I love.

              psychology behind why we make poor decisions, or how Anthony
              Fantano made a mistake by giving MBDTF a 6/10.
