            Iâ€™m still figuring out what my life story would look like here, but
            for now, Iâ€™m happy to share that Iâ€™m a curious learner of all
            things. Iâ€™m a firm believer in the ideologies of doing difficult
            things because they are the most rewarding and seeking discomfort to
            support personal growth. A couple of topics I'm super into: investment psychology, Fornite and the metaverse,
            photography and binge watching David Dobrik vlogs.

            for my next opportunity ideally as a UX Developer or an associate

              Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve been building my craft as a
              photographer. I managed to turn a hobby into a business, which
              allowed me to achieve goals I never thought I could. This included
              photographing the Uber CEO, being paid to travel and working with
              brands I love.

              psychology behind why we make poor decisions, or how Anthony
              Fantano made a mistake by giving MBDTF a 6/10.
